Python bindings to TEOS-10

This package is still in beta testing phase and some of its functions are
likely to evolve over time.

Includes:
- Sea-Ice-Water (SIA) Library 3.0 + simple code fixes (for easy compilation)
- An extra module layer 'Liq_Ice_Air_5a.F90', 'Liq_Ice_Air_5b.F90', 'Liq_Ice_Air_5c.F90' and
    'Liq_Ice_Air_5d.F90' with the temperature, the entropy, the potential temperature,
    the equivalent potential temperature and the pseudo equivalent potential temperature
    valid over the whole region of validity of TEOS-10.
- Two other extra modules 'Liq_Air_4d.F90' and 'Ice_Air_4d.F90' that are very similar
    to 'Liq_Air_4b.F90' and 'Ice_Air_4b.F90' but where one can specify a maximum
    saturation mass fraction in the definition of the Gibbs function. This allows
    to compute the equivalent potential temperature in a clean manner.
- A framework to add python bindings to the Fortran version of TEOS-10 with basic examples.

This package provides a simple way to import the TEOS-10 SIA Library into python.
The current beta version offers a very basic interface to the library. Future versions
will include a better interface and a more extensive physical description of the different
routines available.

NOTE: This package requires a Fortran 90 compiler. Sometimes numpy.disutils will not find
      the installed Fortran compiler and will return an error. It this happens, download the
      source code and run:
        f2py -c --help-fcompiler      
      to find the list of available compilers and then compile:
        python setup.py build --fcompiler=gnu95
      if 'gnu95' was in the list.
