This directory contains the basic routines in the SIA (Sea-Ice-Air) library, corresponding 
to the discussions found in the following papers.

Brief information is included as comment statements in the individual library routines; 
the papers listed above give more detailed information.  In particular, Table 3 and the 
Supplement of Feistel et al. (2009) provides detailed theoretical background information on 
the routines.  Wright et al. (2009) are included to assist users to use the routines in this 
library.

Normally, the elements of the main library modules will be compiled to create module (.mod) and object (.o)
files that can then be linked to the object files corresponding to user routines.  Thus 
compiling only the main library will not create any executable files.  

Compiling and linking:
four different options for compiling and linking are included with the library.

1. Executing the script autogen.sh in the TEOS10-X.Y.Z directory will compile all of the F90 files in this 
directory and populate it with object files, module files, and a library file 
It also produces a Makefile for the routines in this directory.  Using autogen is the simplest 
way to compile the files in this directory if it is supported on your system; if not it might be worth 
adding it.  However, if you don't have the GNU autogen/autoconf/automake tools, you may want to try one 
of the following.

2.  Executing TEOSf90_all_lib.sh will create and execute a simple Makefile for All.F90 which will result 
in all of the F90 files being compiled and the directory will be populated with object and module files.
A makefile for the main library routines will appear as Makefile_All.
This option uses the perl script stored in fmkmf.sh (Fortran MaKe MakeFile). If you use this option you will 
want to use the TEOSf90.sh option to compile routines in the EXAMPLES directory. See the README file in that 
directory for more information.  If neither the autogen nor the TEOSf90_all_lib.sh approaches work for you, 
then you can still go into the SIMPLE_COMPILERS directory and use one of the more basic options included there.

3. If the file makefile in the SIMPLE_COMPILERS directory is copied to this directory, then you should 
be able to compile all routines simply by typing make.  

4. If you copy compile_LIBRARY.sh (which is even more basic) to this directory and enter 
"./compile_LIBRARY.sh <return>" it should also create all of the module and object files.
It will not create a makefile though.
